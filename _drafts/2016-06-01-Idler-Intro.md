The whole city will be a production chain. Each resource (wood, water, meat,etc) is a result from an activity.
So, balancing the activities will be crucial for being able to be absent of the game for some time.

## Development ##

I always wanted to create some kind of Management Game. Did a lot of prototypes but they all were centered in the player building the stuff. Now i want to make one centered in the management.

The basic core of the game is almost done. The input and output of the buildings works properly. 

### Roadmap ###

- Define all the buildings and resources
- Terrain generation: Placements of the natural resources and determine the building oportunities in each node
- Implement a graphical interface for the game. Right now is all code
- Have a working demo for friends
