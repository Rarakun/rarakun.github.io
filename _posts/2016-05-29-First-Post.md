# First Post #

Starting to write a blog it's always hard. I tried many times but i really didn't have much to say. I hope this time is different.

I grew up with videogames. Atari, NES, SEGA, Family Game, the Arcade ones, and then the PC.

I remember tweaking the Civilization Config Files. I think that it was the first time that i did something that felt like coding. Creating new civilizations, stats and stuffs like that.

That tweaking turned into a passion for programming. And that passion was the base for my career in software development.

But now i want to turn that passion for coding, for playing and learning to live inside games.


I don't promise excellency in the content of this blog, but a sincere approach to the different problems that i'll face while in gamedev.
